ðŸŒŸ McHacks Hackathon 2023

In 2022, Canada alone wasted an estimated $30 billion in food. Meanwhile, 3 billion Canadians today cannot afford healthy meals. Something about these numbers just doesn't add up.

That's why, for McHacks 10, our team set out to combine the ever-pressing problem of food waste with the sharply rising rates of food insecurity by creating an app that connects local restaurant owners with Canadians in need, putting delicious meals on the table instead of in the trash for those who would otherwise not be able to afford it. Unlike other apps that offer food bundles at a reduced price, however, we opted to take it one step further -- inspired by the heartwarming success stories of Laurier University's recent Distro program, we decided that our program would offer its meals completely free of charge. After all, everyone deserves a chance to eat.

Of course, that applies to restaurant owners too. To compensate for consumers' inability to pay, we decided to flip the script on your typical loyalty program and reward not the consumers, but the restaurant owners with loyalty points for each bundle given out. 100% of the periodic ad revenue generated from our app will go directly into supporting the generous restaurant owners working with us, with a higher percentage of ad revenue going to the restaurant owners who donate the most bundles.
